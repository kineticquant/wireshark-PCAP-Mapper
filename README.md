+ Wireshark, Streamlit, and NetworkX

### About
Written in Python and using Streamlit, this is a lightweight, rapid-analysis utility designed to read and parse packet capture (*.pcap, or *.pcapng) files from Wireshark or a similar utility, and subsequently maps the network connections out in a visible network graph. The utility also provides a Pandas Dataframe as an export of the packet capture, which can be downloaded as an Excel file for further analysis.

Simply upload a .pcap or .pcapng file, and the utility will handle the rest. This makes troubleshooting connections or searching for malicious actors from a packet capture much easier than digging through the packet capture itself.
